These differences enable vLLMs to excel in tasks like language translation, text generation, and conversational AI, whereas traditional models are better suited for tasks like image classification or regression. ========= TensorRT (Triton Runtime) optimizes LLM (Large Language Model) inference on NVIDIA hardware by: 1. **Model Pruning**: Removing unnecessary weights and connections to reduce model size and computational requirements. 2. **Quantization**: Converting floating-point models to lower-precision integer formats (e.g., INT8) to reduce memory bandwidth and improve performance. 3. **Kernel Fusion**: Combining multiple kernel launches into a single launch to reduce overhead and improve parallelism. 4. **Optimized Tensor Cores**: Utilizing NVIDIA's Tensor Cores for matrix multiplication, which provides significant performance boosts. 5. **Batching**: Processing multiple input batches concurrently to improve throughput. 6. **Mixed Precision**: Using a combination of floating-point and integer precision to balance accuracy and performance. 7. **Graph Optimization**: Reordering and reorganizing the computation graph to minimize memory access and optimize data transfer. By applying these optimizations, TensorRT can significantly accelerate LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware, achieving faster inference times and improved performance. =========   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Open WebUI Deployment​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NVIDIA NIM LLM Deployment on Amazon EKS","url":"/ai-on-eks/docs/ai/inference/GPUs/nvidia-nim-llama3#open-webui-deployment","content":" info Open WebUI is compatible only with models that work with the OpenAI API server and Ollama.  1.

The core strength of Triton lies in its support for various backends, which provide the flexibility and power needed to handle different types of models and workloads effectively.  Once a request reaches the Triton K8s Service, it is processed by the Triton Server. The server supports dynamic batching, allowing multiple inference requests to be grouped together to optimize processing. This is particularly useful in scenarios with high throughput requirements, as it helps reduce latency and improve overall performance.  Requests are then managed by scheduled queues, ensuring that each model's inference requests are processed in an orderly manner. The Triton Server supports selective and compute model loading, which means it can dynamically load models based on the current workload and resource availability. This feature is crucial for efficiently managing the resources in a multi-model deployment.  The backbone of Triton’s inference capabilities are its various backends, including TensorRT-LLM and vLLM:  TensorRT-LLM: TensorRT-LLM backend optimizes large language model (LLM) inference on NVIDIA GPUs. Leveraging TensorRT's high-performance capabilities, it accelerates inference, providing low-latency and high-throughput performance. TensorRT is particularly well-suited for deep learning models that require intensive computational resources, making it ideal for real-time AI applications.  vLLM: vLLM backend is specifically designed to handle various LLM workloads. It offers efficient memory management and execution pipelines tailored for large models. This backend ensures that memory resources are used optimally, allowing for the deployment of very large models without running into memory bottlenecks. vLLM is crucial for applications that need to serve multiple large models simultaneously, providing a robust and scalable solution.

[/INST] Traditional machine learning models (MLMs) are trained on specific datasets and features to learn patterns and make predictions based on that data. They require labeled data for training and are limited by the size and diversity of the training data. MLMs can be effective for solving structured problems, such as image recognition or speech recognition. Very Large Language Models (vLLMs), on the other hand, are trained on vast amounts of text data using deep learning techniques. They learn to generate human-like text based on the input they receive. vLLMs can understand and generate text in a more contextually aware and nuanced way than MLMs. They can also perform a wider range of tasks, such as text summarization, translation, and question answering. However, vLLMs can be more computationally expensive and require large amounts of data and power to train. They also have the potential to generate inaccurate or biased responses if not properly managed. ========= &lt;s&gt;[INST]&lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt; Keep short answers of no more than 100 sentences. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt; Can you explain how TensorRT optimizes LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware? [/INST] TensorRT is a deep learning inference optimization tool from NVIDIA. It utilizes dynamic and static analysis to optimize deep learning models for inference on NVIDIA GPUs. For Maximum Likelihood Modeling (LLM) inference, TensorRT applies the following optimizations: 1. Model Optimization: TensorRT converts the LLM model into an optimized format, such as INT8 or FP16, which reduces memory usage and increases inference speed. 2. Engine Generation: TensorRT generates a custom engine for the optimized model, which includes kernel optimizations for specific NVIDIA GPUs. 3. Memory Optimization: TensorRT minimizes memory usage by using data layout optimizations, memory pooling, and other techniques. 4. Execution Optimization: TensorRT optimizes the execution of the engine on the GPU by scheduling and managing thread execution, reducing latency and increasing throughput. 5. I/O Optimization: TensorRT optimizes input and output data transfer between the host and the GPU, reducing the time spent on data transfer and increasing overall inference speed. 6. Dynamic Batching: TensorRT dynamically batches input data to maximize GPU utilization and reduce latency. 7. Multi-Streaming: TensorRT supports multi-streaming, allowing multiple inference requests to be processed concurrently, increasing overall throughput. 8. Profiling and Monitoring: TensorRT provides profiling and monitoring tools to help developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their models further. Overall, TensorRT optimizes LLM inference on NVIDIA hardware by applying a combination of model, engine, memory, execution, I/O, dynamic batching, multi-streaming, and profiling optimizations.   Now, try to run the inference on the Llama-2-7b-chat model with the same prompts and observe the output under a new file called llama2_results.txt.  python3 triton-client.py --model-name llama2 --input-prompts prompts.txt --results-file llama2_results.txt   Output should look like:  python3 triton-client.py --model-name llama2 --input-prompts prompts.txt --results-file llama2_results.txt Loading inputs from `prompts.txt`...

It includes container insights for tracking key performance metrics such as CPU and memory utilization. Additionally, the blueprint integrates GPU metrics using NVIDIA's DCGM plugin, which is essential for monitoring high-performance GPU workloads. For machine learning models running on AWS Inferentia or Trainium, the Neuron Monitor plugin is added to capture and report Neuron-specific metrics.  All metrics, including container insights, GPU performance, and Neuron metrics, are sent to Amazon CloudWatch, where you can monitor and analyze them in real-time. After the deployment is complete, you should be able to access these metrics directly from the CloudWatch console, allowing you to manage and optimize your workloads effectively.  In addition to deploying CloudWatch EKS addon, we have also deployed the Kube Prometheus stack, which provides Prometheus server and Grafana deployments for monitoring and observability.  First, let's verify the services deployed by the Kube Prometheus stack:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack   You should see output similar to this:  kubectl get svc -n kube-prometheus-stack NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE kube-prometheus-stack-grafana ClusterIP 172.20.252.10 &lt;none&gt; 80/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-kube-state-metrics ClusterIP 172.20.34.181 &lt;none&gt; 8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-operator ClusterIP 172.20.186.93 &lt;none&gt; 443/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus ClusterIP 172.20.147.64 &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP,8080/TCP 11d kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-node-exporter ClusterIP 172.20.171.165 &lt;none&gt; 9100/TCP 11d prometheus-operated ClusterIP None &lt;none&gt; 9090/TCP 11d   To expose the NVIDIA Triton server metrics, we have deployed a metrics service(nvidia-triton-server-triton-inference-server-metrics) on port 8080.

You can visualize these metrics using the Grafana dashboard.  In the Grafana dashboard below, you can see several important metrics:  Average GPU Power Usage: This gauge shows the current power usage of the GPU, which is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and performance of your inference tasks.Compute Time (milliseconds): This bar graph displays the time taken to compute inference requests, helping identify any latency issues.Cumulative Inference Requests: This graph shows the total number of inference requests processed over time, providing insights into the workload and performance trends.Queue Time (milliseconds): This line graph indicates the time requests spend in the queue before being processed, highlighting potential bottlenecks in the system.

[/INST] The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the relationship between space and time, and how matter and energy interact within that framework. It is actually composed of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity, published in 1905, and the General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915. The Special Theory of Relativity is based on two postulates: the first one states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference (frames that are not accelerating); the second one asserts that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the source of the light. From these two postulates, several counter-intuitive consequences follow. For example, the length of an object contracts when it is in motion relative to an observer, and time dilation occurs, meaning that a moving clock appears to tick slower than a stationary one. These phenomena have been confirmed by numerous experiments. The General Theory of Relativity is a theory of gravitation, which extended the Special Theory of Relativity by incorporating gravity into the fabric of spacetime. In this theory, mass causes a distortion or curvature in spacetime, which is felt as a gravitational force. This is in contrast to the Newtonian view of gravity as a force acting at a distance between two masses. One of the most famous predictions of General Relativity is the bending of light by gravity, which was first observed during a solar eclipse in 1919. The theory has been extremely successful in explaining various phenomena, such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, the gravitational redshift of light, and the existence of black holes and gravitational waves. In summary, the theory of relativity is a groundbreaking theory in physics that fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. It has been incredibly successful in making accurate predictions about the natural world and has stood the test of time through numerous experiments and observations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Observability​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Deploying LLMs with RayServe and vLLM","url":"/ai-on-eks/docs/ai/inference/GPUs/vLLM-rayserve#observability","content":" As part of this blueprint, we have also deployed the Kube Prometheus stack, which provides Prometheus server and Grafana deployments for monitoring and observability.

However, by default, the Ray head Pod represents a single point of failure; if it fails, the entire cluster including the Ray worker Pods need to be restarted.  To address this, High Availability (HA) for the Ray head node is essential. Global Control Service (GCS) manages cluster-level metadata in a RayCluster. By default, the GCS lacks fault tolerance as it stores all data in-memory, and a failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To avoid this, one must add fault tolerance to Ray’s Global Control Store (GCS), which allows the Ray Serve application to serve traffic even when the head node crashes. In the event of a GCS restart, it retrieves all the data from the Redis instance and resumes its regular functions.      Following sections provide the steps on how to enable GCS fault tolerance and ensure high availability for the Ray head Pod.

You can choose to host your own Redis database, or you can use one through a third-party vendor.  For development and testing purposes, you can also host a containerized Redis database on the same EKS cluster as your Ray cluster. However, for production setups, it's recommended to use a highly available external Redis cluster. In this pattern, we've used Amazon ElasticCache for Redis to create an external Redis cluster. You can also choose to use Amazon memoryDB for setting up a Redis cluster.  As part of the current blueprint, we've added a terraform module named elasticache that creates an Elastic Cache Redis cluster in AWS. This uses The Redis cluster has cluster mode disabled and contain one node. This cluster node's endpoint can be used for both reads and writes.  Key things to note in this module are -  The Redis Cluster is in the same VPC as the EKS cluster. If the Redis cluster is created in a separate VPC, then VPC peering needs to be set up between the EKS cluster VPC and the Elastic Cache Redis cluster VPC to enable network connectivity.A cache subnet group needs to be created at the time of creating the Redis cluster. A subnet group is a collection of subnets that you may want to designate for your caches in a VPC. ElastiCache uses that cache subnet group to assign IP addresses within that subnet to each cache node in the cache. The blueprint automatically adds all the subnets used by the EKS cluster in the subnet group for the Elastic cache Redis cluster.Security Group - The Security Group assigned to the Redis cache needs to have an inbound rule that allows TCP traffic from EKS Cluster's worker node security group to the Redis cluster security group over port 6379. This is because the Ray head Pod needs to establish a connection to the Elastic cache Redis cluster over port 6379. The blueprint automatically sets up the security group with the inbound rule.  To create the Redis cluster using Amazon Elastic Cache, please follow the below steps.  info This Mistral7b deployment is using Ray Serve with High availability. If you have already deployed mistral7b in the previous steps, then you can delete the deployment and run the below steps.  Prerequisites:  aws clikubectlterraformenvsubstjq  First, enable the creation of the Redis cluster by setting the enable_rayserve_ha_elastic_cache_redis variable to true by running the below command.

In contrast, Trn1/Inf2 instances, such as trn1.32xlarge, trn1n.32xlarge, inf2.24xlarge and inf2.48xlarge, are purpose built for high-performance deep learning (DL) training and inference of generative AI models, including LLMs. They offer both scalability and availability, ensuring that you can deploy and scale your Stable-diffusion-xl models as needed, without resource bottlenecks or delays.  Cost Optimization:Running LLMs on traditional GPU instances can be cost-prohibitive, especially given the scarcity of GPUs and their competitive pricing.Trn1/Inf2 instances provide a cost-effective alternative. By offering dedicated hardware optimized for AI and machine learning tasks, Trn1/Inf2 instances allow you to achieve top-notch performance at a fraction of the cost. This cost optimization enables you to allocate your budget efficiently, making LLM deployment accessible and sustainable.  Performance BoostWhile Stable-Diffusion-xl can achieve high-performance inference on GPUs, Neuron accelerators take performance to the next level. Neuron accelerators are purpose-built for machine learning workloads, providing hardware acceleration that significantly enhances Stable-diffusion's inference speeds. This translates to faster response times and improved user experiences when deploying Stable-Diffusion-xl on Trn1/Inf2 instances.

It handles the following tasks:  Initializes a distributed backend (e.g., c10d, NCCL) for communication between worker processes.In our example it's using c10d. This is a commonly used distributed backend in PyTorch that can leverage different communication mechanisms like TCP or Infiniband depending on your environment.Sets up environment variables to enable distributed training within your training script.Launches your training script on all worker pods, ensuring each process participates in the distributed training.  cd examples/training kubectl apply -f esm1nv_pretrain-job.yaml   Run the below command to look for the pods esm1nv-pretraining-worker-*  kubectl get pods   NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE esm1nv-pretraining-worker-0 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-1 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-2 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-3 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-4 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-5 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-6 1/1 Running 0 11m esm1nv-pretraining-worker-7 1/1 Running 0 11m   We should see 8 pods running. In the pod definition we have specified 8 worker replicas with 1 gpu limit for each. Karpenter provisioned 2 g5.12xlarge instance with 4 GPUs each. Since we set up &quot;nprocPerNode&quot; to &quot;4&quot;, each node will be responsible for 4 jobs. For more details around distributed pytorch training see pytorch docs.  info This training job can run for at least 3-4 days with g5.12xlarge nodes.  This configuration utilizes Kubeflow's PyTorch training Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Within this manifest, various parameters are available for customization. For detailed insights into each parameter and guidance on fine-tuning, you can refer to BioNeMo's documentation.  info Based on the Kubeflow training operator documentation, if you do not specify the master replica pod explicitly, the first worker replica pod(worker-0) will be treated as the master pod.

Handle larger datasets that might not fit on a single GPU's memory.  Conclusion​  BioNeMo stands as a formidable generative AI tool tailored for the realm of drug discovery. In this illustrative example, we took the initiative to pretrain a custom model entirely from scratch, utilizing the extensive uniref50 dataset. However, it's worth noting that BioNeMo offers the flexibility to expedite the process by employing pretrained models directly provided by NVidia. This alternative approach can significantly streamline your workflow while maintaining the robust capabilities of the BioNeMo framework.

We continue to collect and post those recommendations here. Because this is an ongoing effort, please open an Issue or Pull Request if you find something outdated so we can update it. These AI on EKS Best Practices are meant to expand upon the EKS Best Practices Guide for data-centric use cases (e.g., batch processing, stream processing, and machine learning) and we recommend reviewing the EKS Best Practices as a primer before diving into these. The AI on EKS Best Practices are not comprehensive and we recommend you read through the guidance and determine what’s best for your environment. The recommendations here were built from working with customers one of two designs (listed below). Each data use case (e.g., batch processing, stream processing) aligns more closely to one of the two cluster designs, which we will call out in our recommendations. The first design is dynamic clusters that scale, or “churn”, a lot. These clusters run batch processing with Spark, or other workloads that create pods for a relatively short time but can vary greatly on the scale at any given time. These clusters create and delete resources like pods and nodes, or churn, at a high rate which adds unique pressures to Kubernetes and critical components.The other design is “static” clusters. These clusters are often large but have less volatile scaling behavior and are generally running longer-lived jobs, like streaming or training. Avoid interruptions for these workloads is a key concern and care must be taken when making changes. When we talk about large clusters or high rates of churn, it’s difficult to put a specific number to those phrases because of the complexity of kubernetes scalability. In general, these clusters have &gt;500 nodes and &gt;5000 pods, or are creating/destroying hundreds of resources a minute; however, the scalability constraints are different for every workload (even between two different Spark jobs).","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Llama2 Distributed Pre-training on Trn1 with RayTrain and KubeRay","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ai-on-eks/docs/ai/training/Neuron/RayTrain-Llama2","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"What is Llama-2?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Llama2 Distributed Pre-training on Trn1 with RayTrain and KubeRay","url":"/ai-on-eks/docs/ai/training/Neuron/RayTrain-Llama2#what-is-llama-2","content":" Llama-2 is a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, and more.

The combination of RayTrain and KubeRay, especially when leveraged with AWS Trainium, provides a robust framework for handling these demands efficiently and effectively:  RayTrain:​  Simplified Distributed Training: RayTrain is a high-level library built on the Ray framework that abstracts the complexities of distributed training. It allows you to scale your Llama-2 training across multiple nodes with minimal code changes. Ray's actor-based architecture and task-based parallelism enable efficient execution of distributed workloads.Flexible Strategies: RayTrain supports various distributed training strategies such as data parallelism and model parallelism. Data parallelism splits the dataset across multiple nodes, while model parallelism splits the model itself. This flexibility allows you to optimize training based on the specific needs of your model and the architecture of your training environment.Fault Tolerance: RayTrain includes built-in fault tolerance mechanisms. If a node fails, Ray can reschedule the tasks on other available nodes, ensuring that the training job continues without interruption. This feature is crucial for maintaining robustness in large-scale distributed training environments.Ease of Use: RayTrain offers intuitive APIs that simplify the setup and execution of distributed training jobs. Integrations with popular machine learning libraries like Hugging Face Transformers make it easier to incorporate RayTrain into your existing workflows without extensive modifications.  KubeRay:​  Integration with Kubernetes: KubeRay leverages Kubernetes' native capabilities to deploy, manage, and scale Ray clusters. This integration allows you to use Kubernetes' robust orchestration features to handle Ray workloads effectively.Dynamic Scaling: KubeRay supports dynamic scaling of Ray clusters. Ray's built-in autoscaler can request additional actor replicas based on workload demands, while Kubernetes tools like Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler manage the creation of new nodes to meet these demands.Horizontal Scaling: Scale your Ray clusters horizontally by adding more worker nodes as the computational load increases. This allows efficient handling of large-scale distributed training and inference tasks.Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): KubeRay utilizes Kubernetes CRDs to define and manage Ray clusters and jobs. This provides a standardized way to handle Ray workloads within the Kubernetes ecosystem.Fault Tolerance: KubeRay takes advantage of Kubernetes' self-healing capabilities. If a Ray head node or worker node fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts the failed components, ensuring minimal downtime and continuous operation.Distributed Scheduling: Ray's actor-based model and distributed task scheduling, combined with Kubernetes' orchestration, ensure high availability and efficient task execution even in the event of node failures.Declarative Configuration: KubeRay allows you to define Ray clusters and jobs using declarative YAML configurations. This simplifies the deployment and management process, making it easier to set up and maintain Ray clusters.Integrated Logging and Monitoring: KubeRay integrates with Kubernetes' logging and monitoring tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana. This provides comprehensive insights into the performance and health of Ray clusters, facilitating easier debugging and optimization.Spot Instances: Use Kubernetes' support for spot instances to run Ray clusters cost-effectively. This allows you to take advantage of lower-cost compute resources while maintaining the ability to scale as needed.  AWS Trainium:​  Optimized for Deep Learning: AWS Trainium-based Trn1 instances are specifically designed for deep learning workloads. They offer high throughput and low latency, making them ideal for training large-scale models like Llama-2. Trainium chips provide significant performance improvements over traditional processors, accelerating training times.Neuron SDK: The AWS Neuron SDK is tailored to optimize your deep learning models for Trainium. It includes features like advanced compiler optimizations and support for mixed precision training, which can further accelerate your training workloads while maintaining accuracy.

When designing the VPC for your environment plan for more IP addresses than just your pods to accommodate this warm pool.  With the default VPC CNI configuration larger nodes will consume more IP addresses. For example a m5.8xlarge node that is running 10 pods will hold 60 IPs total (to satisfy WARM_ENI=1). However a m5.16xlarge node would hold 100 IPs. Configuring the VPC CNI to minimize this warm pool can increase the EC2 API calls from your nodes and increase the risk of rate throttling.

You can add additional VPC CIDRs from a range that is not routable across VPCs (such as the RFC 6598 range, 100.64.0.0/10). In this case we added 100.64.0.0/16, 100.65.0.0/16, and 100.66.0.0/16 to the VPC (as this is the maximum CIDR size), then created new subnets with those CIDRs. Finally we recreated the node groups in the new subnets, leaving the existing EKS cluster control plane in place.

As the VPC CNI launches it tries to provision a Warm Pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to Kubernetes Pods (More details in the EKS Best Practices Guide).  The VPC CNI must make AWS EC2 API calls (like AssignPrivateIpV4Address and DescribeNetworkInterfaces) to assign those additional IPs and ENIs to the worker node. When the EKS cluster scales out the number of Nodes or Pods there could be a spike in the number of these EC2 API calls. This surge of calls could encounter rate throttling from the EC2 API to help the performance of the service, and to ensure fair usage for all Amazon EC2 customers. This rate throttling can cause the pool of IP address to be exhausted while the CNI tries to allocate more IPs.  These failures will cause errors like the one below, indicating that the provisioning of the container network namespace has failed because the VPC CNI could not provision an IP address.

For some workloads the CPU, Memory, or other resource will limit the number of Pods on that c5.18xlarge before we need more than 50 IPs.

To limit the IPs and stop k8s from scheduling too many pods you will need to:  Update the CNI configuration environment variables to set MAX_ENI=1Update the --max-pods option for the kubelet on the worker nodes.  To configure the --max-pods option you can update the userdata for your worker nodes to set this option via the --kubelet -extra-args in the bootstrap.sh script. By default this script configures the max-pods value for the kubelet, the --use-max-pods false` option disables this behavior when providing your own value:   eks_managed_node_groups = { system = { instance_types = [&quot;m5.xlarge&quot;] min_size = 0 max_size = 5 desired_size = 3 pre_bootstrap_user_data = &lt;&lt;-EOT EOT bootstrap_extra_args = &quot;--use-max-pods false --kubelet-extra-args '--max-pods=&lt;your_value&gt;'&quot; }   One problem is the number of IPs per ENI is different based on the Instance type (for example a m5d.2xlarge can have 15 IPs per ENI, where a m5d.4xlarge can hold 30 IPs per ENI). This means hard-coding a value for max-pods may cause problems if you change instance types or in mixed-instance environments.  In the EKS Optimized AMI releases there is a script included that can be used to help calculate the AWS Recommended max-pods value. If you’d like to automate this calculation for mixed instances you will also need to update the userdata for your instances to use the --instance-type-from-imds flag to autodiscover the instance type from instance metadata.   eks_managed_node_groups = { system = { instance_types = [&quot;m5.xlarge&quot;] min_size = 0 max_size = 5 desired_size = 3 pre_bootstrap_user_data = &lt;&lt;-EOT /etc/eks/max-pod-calc.sh --instance-type-from-imds —cni-version 1.13.4 —cni-max-eni 1 EOT bootstrap_extra_args = &quot;--use-max-pods false --kubelet-extra-args '--max-pods=&lt;your_value&gt;'&quot; }   Maxpods with Karpenter​  By default, Nodes provisioned by Karpenter will have the max pods on a node based on the node instance type.

The default ndots setting in Kubernetes is five, if your application isn’t talking to other pods in the cluster, we can set the ndots to a low value like “2”.

Colocating workloads in the same AZ serves two main purposes:  Reduce inter-AZ traffic costsReduce network latency between executors/Pods  To have pods co-located on the same AZ, we can use podAffinity based scheduling constraints.

Step2: Create additional features from the existing ones that might provide more useful information for predicting loan performance. For example, you could extract features like loan-to-value ratio, borrower's credit score range, or loan origination year.  Step3: Divide the dataset into two parts: one for training the XGBoost model and one for evaluating its performance. This allows you to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  Step4: Feed the training dataset into XGBoost to train the model. XGBoost will analyze the loan attributes and their corresponding loan performance labels to learn the patterns and relationships between them. The objective is to predict whether a loan is likely to default or perform well based on the given features.  Step5: Once the model is trained, use the evaluation dataset to assess its performance. This involves analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to measure how well the model predicts loan performance  Step6: If the performance is not satisfactory, you can tune the XGBoost hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, tree depth, or regularization parameters, to improve the model's accuracy or address issues like overfitting.  Step7: Finally, with a trained and validated XGBoost model, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen loan data. These predictions can help in identifying potential risks associated with loan default or evaluating loan performance.

The ability to monitor GPU usage in real-time, identify trends, and detect anomalies can significantly impact performance tuning, troubleshooting, and efficient resource utilization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator plays a key role in GPU observability. It automates the deployment of the necessary components to run GPU workloads on Kubernetes. One of its components, the DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) Exporter, is an open-source project that exports GPU metrics in a format that can be ingested by Prometheus, a leading open-source monitoring solution. These metrics include GPU temperature, memory usage, GPU utilization, and more. The DCGM Exporter allows you to monitor these metrics on a per-GPU basis, providing granular visibility into your GPU resources.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator, in combination with the DCGM Exporter, exports GPU metrics to a Prometheus server. With its flexible query language, Prometheus allows you to slice and dice data to generate insights into resource usage patterns.  However, Prometheus is not designed for long-term data storage. This is where the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) comes into play. It provides a fully-managed, secure, and scalable service for Prometheus that makes it easy to analyze operational data at scale without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.  Visualizing these metrics and creating informative dashboards is where Grafana excels. Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, offering rich visualizations to represent collected metrics intuitively. When combined with Prometheus, Grafana can display the GPU metrics collected by the DCGM Exporter in a user-friendly manner.  The NVIDIA GPU Operator is configured to export metrics to the Prometheus server, which then remote-writes these metrics to Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). As a user, you can log into the Grafana WebUI, deployed as part of the blueprint, and add AMP as a data source. Following this, you can import the open-source GPU monitoring dashboard that presents GPU metrics in an easily digestible format, facilitating real-time performance monitoring and resource optimization.  NVIDIA GPU Operator: Installed on your Kubernetes cluster, the NVIDIA GPU Operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of GPU resources. It deploys NVIDIA drivers and the DCGM Exporter on each GPU-equipped node.DCGM Exporter: The DCGM Exporter runs on each node, collecting GPU metrics and exposing them to Prometheus.Prometheus: Prometheus is a time-series database that collects metrics from various sources, including the DCGM Exporter. It pulls metrics from the exporter at regular intervals and stores them. In this setup, you would configure Prometheus to remote-write the collected metrics to AMP.Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP): AMP is a fully-managed Prometheus service provided by AWS. It takes care of long-term storage, scalability, and security of your Prometheus data.Grafana: Grafana is a visualization tool that can query AMP for the collected metrics, and display them on informative dashboards.  In this blueprint, we leverage DCGM to write GPU metrics to both Prometheus and Amazon Managed Prometheus (AMP). To verify the GPU metrics, you can use Grafana by running the following command:  kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:80 -n grafana `` Login to Grafana using `admin` as the username, and retrieve the password from Secrets Manager using the following AWS CLI command: ```bash aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id emr-spark-rapids-grafana --region us-west-2   Once logged in, add the AMP datasource to Grafana and import the Open Source GPU monitoring dashboard. You can then explore the metrics and visualize them using the Grafana dashboard, as shown in the screenshot below.

Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is optimized for applications that need high read throughput to large objects, potentially from many clients at once, and to write new objects sequentially from a single client at a time. It offers significant performance gains compared to traditional S3 access methods, making it ideal for data-intensive workloads and AI/ML training.  A key feature of Mountpoint-S3 is its compatibility with both Amazon S3 Standrad and Amazon S3 Express One Zone. S3 Express One Zone is a high-performance storage class designed for single-Availability Zone deployment. It offers consistent single-digit millisecond data access, making it ideal for frequently accessed data and latency-sensitive applications. S3 Express One Zone is known for delivering data access speeds up to 10 times faster and at up to 50% lower request costs compared to S3 Standard. This storage class enables users to co-locate storage and compute resources in the same Availability Zone, optimizing performance and potentially reducing compute costs.  The integration with S3 Express One Zone enhances Mountpoint-S3's capabilities, particularly for machine learning and analytics workloads, as it can be used with services like Amazon EKS, Amazon SageMaker Model Training, Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and AWS Glue Data Catalog. The automatic scaling of storage based on consumption in S3 Express One Zone simplifies management for low-latency workloads, making Mountpoint-S3 a highly effective tool for a wide range of data-intensive tasks and AI/ML training environments.  warning Mountpoint-S3 does not support file renaming operations, which may limit its applicability in scenarios where such functionality is essential.
